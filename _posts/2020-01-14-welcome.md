## Learning as optimization :

We will start by only relying on our ability to formulate an optimization problem. Along the way we will discover several useful mathematical tricks with our sole objective being better understanding.

### Digression : Linear Algebra.

{% include info.html text="Linear Algebra helps us in framing our optimization problems more compactly. We will later look at the subject from different perspectives to help us develop deeper appreciation of it's applications.But,for now I will suffice with a quick recap of some basic results." %}




`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "level 1 heading" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line "## Nice to meet you" above.$\sum_n (x)$.
