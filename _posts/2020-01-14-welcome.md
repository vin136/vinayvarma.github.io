## Learning as optimization :

We will start by only relying on our ability to formulate an optimization problem. Along the way we will discover several useful mathematical tricks with our sole objective being better understanding.

### Digression : Linear Algebra.

{% include info.html text="Linear Algebra helps us in framing our optimization problems more compactly. We will later look at the subject from different perspectives to help us develop deeper appreciation of it's applications. But,for now I will suffice with a quick recap of some basic results." %}
